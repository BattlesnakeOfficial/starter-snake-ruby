# starter-snake-ruby

A simple [Battlesnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Ruby.

Visit [https://github.com/battlesnakeio/community/blob/master/starter-snakes.md](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/community/blob/master/starter-snakes.md) for API documentation and instructions for running your AI.

This AI client uses the Sinatra web framework for running your snake server.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### You will need...

* A working ruby development environment ([installing ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/))
* experience [deploying Ruby apps to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#introduction)
* [bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started) to install Ruby dependencies

## Running the Snake Locally

1) [Fork this repo](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/battlesnake-2-ruby/fork).

2) Clone repo to your development environment:
```
git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/battlesnake-2-ruby.git
```

3) Install dependencies using [bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started):
```
bundle install
```

   - if you get an error saying you don't have the right ruby version, you can use [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
   - once you have it, use `rvm install 2.5.0` then `rvm use 2.5.0` (it may prompt you to use 2.4.0, but use 2.5.0)

4) Run local server:
```
ruby app/app.rb
```
   - if this doesn't work, make sure you have run `rvm use 2.5.0` in the terminal pane you're running the server in first.

5) Test your snake by sending a curl to the running snake
```
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "hello": "world"}' http://localhost:4567/start
```
   - or visit [the URL](http://localhost:4567/start) in your browser and you should see a white screen with the text "Sinatra doesnâ€™t know this ditty" and a microphone.

6) Get the local game engine
   - download `engine_0.2.25_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` (Darwin is for macOS) from here: https://github.com/battlesnakeio/engine/releases/tag/0.2.25 

7) Start the engine:
   - be in engine directory: `cd engine_0.2.25_Darwin_x86_64`
   - run `./engine dev`
   - you should now be able to visit the local game board here: http://localhost:3010/

8) Start a game to test your snake:
   - TBA


## Deploying to Heroku

1) Create a new Heroku app:
```
heroku create [APP_NAME]
```

2) Deploy code to Heroku servers:
```
git push heroku master
```

3) Open Heroku app in browser:
```
heroku open
```
or visit [http://APP_NAME.herokuapp.com](http://APP_NAME.herokuapp.com).

4) View server logs with the `heroku logs` command:
```
heroku logs --tail
```
